## Why Am I Commiting myself to doing TryHackMe
I have notice comming to the end of my collegate career that I'm not where I would like to be at with my technical skills.
Iam practicing for my Security+ exam which through my curriculum and studies is a lot of theretical knowledge.
So this is my way of filling in those gaps and it in a gamified format which is easy to disgest.
